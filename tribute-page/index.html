          <p>
            Linus Torvalds' work has transformed the technology industry. Linux
            powers over 90% of the world's supercomputers, most of the
            internet's servers, and billions of Android devices. Git is the
            foundation for collaborative software development globally. His
            commitment to open-source principles remains a cornerstone of his
            legacy.
