# Hey, Ignacio Here.

These are the Responsive Web Design Certification projects from freecodecamp.org.

I had fun building these little projects, so if you're looking to improve your coding skills, I highly recommend tackling this certification.

Coding sometimes is hard, but only we need some constancy to understand and give some time to study the fundamental concepts. It's really important to have discipline for whatever we want to achieve in any field of our lives.

## Here are the projects I made to receive the certification

Yep, as I said, coding is hard. But is magic, wonderful, powerful as well. This passionate world is for those who are curious and self-taught and interested in understanding how the world works nowadays.

At first, you may not feel like a coding expert. But everyone has a starting point, right? Go to your computer and start doing something, it doesn't matter what it is, just write some code. You might be surprised at how talented you are.
